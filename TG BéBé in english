# How to use Spiec-Easi (Sparse and Compositionally Robust Inference of Microbial Ecological Networks)?

This tutorial is intended for novices who wants to get acquainted with network inference via the Spiec-Easi model (Kurtz et al., 2015).

I chose this model because it addresses two major problems of correlation-based models:   

  1)it uses the concept of conditional dependence to avoid the detection of correlated but indirectly connected taxa. Correlation is a pairwise metric and therefore limited in a multivariate framework.
  2)it takes into account the compositionality of the data by applying a "clr" transformation on the input abundance table.
